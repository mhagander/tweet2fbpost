To make this thing work, you need a tweet2fbpost.ini file
that contains something along the line of:


[twitter]
user = <something>
consumer=<from twitter>
consumersecret=<from twitter>
token=<from twitter>
secret=<from twitter>

[facebook]
pageid=1231231231231
pagetoken=CAKLJsdfjksdhfDFJODHFKJH4324234

Note that you need to register yourself with the twitter developer
console, and get the secrets and tokens from there.

You also need to set up to be able to post to facebook:

#1. Create an app as a facebook developer, so you can get the secret
#2. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/, and get an access token with
    manage_pages and publish_actions permissions (extended permissions). This will grant
    access to post on your personal wall as well - don't worry, we're going to throw
    that token away in a minute.
#3. Using the explorer, make a GET request for /me/accuonts
#4. Locate the page we should post to in the resulting JSON. Record the id and the
    access token (page specific!) inthe INI file per above.
